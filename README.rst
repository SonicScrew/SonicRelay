SonicRelay Documentation
==========================

SonicRelay is a simple message relay that extracts
an encrypted SonicText transaction from a local,
designated mailbox. It then dispatches the encrypted transaction
to the SonicCoin wallet where it is decrypted and
broadcast to the SonicCoin Tor network.

The full docs are in the html directory at the
root of the SonicRelay repository at GitHub.
